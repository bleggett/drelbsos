# DrelbsOS

An Atari-approved, Spectrum-certified, disgustingly personal variant of [Bazzite](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite).

Notably

- Steam Deck and non-desktop-related stuff stripped out.
- No Steam/Lutris/Wine as system components - use the flatpaks like a normal person, don't be a degenerate.
- NVIDIA and plain old GNOME only, as God intended.
- zsh standard
- cdemu bits installed by default
- no btop horseshit
- Sorry, no secure boot. This is a toy. That would be absurd. PRs welcome.
