# DrelbsOS

An Atari-approved, ZX Spectrum-certified, disgustingly personal Fedora Atomic variant, based on bootc. 

DrelbsOS is indebted to the amazing work Universal Blue has done to make building Fedora OSTree/bootc variants ridiculously simple.

TODO, as this is a personal distro for play machines, and not security focused. I don't use this for machines I want to protect and neither should you.
